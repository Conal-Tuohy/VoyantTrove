VoyantTrove is a Docker multi-container application which integrates the Trove Query Builder Form, the TroveProxy format converter, and the language research tool Voyant.

Note that the two Docker images referenced in `compose.yaml` to implement the `trove-proxy` and `voyant` services are built from the repositories [TroveProxy](https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/TroveProxy) and [VoyantDocker](https://github.com/Conal-Tuohy/VoyantDocker), respectively.
